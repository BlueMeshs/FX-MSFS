# FX-MSFS
Free FX projects for Microsoft Flight Simulator

You can use these project for your free and payeware aircrafts. One thing is needed, credit me: "BlueMesh" in your aircraft description ( Marketplace, SimmMarket, SellerMarket...)

Each aircraft are differents so your must probably ajust the node graph in MSFS

Enjoy :D
